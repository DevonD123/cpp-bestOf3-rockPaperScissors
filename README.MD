simple c++ program designed to build a best of 3 rock paper scissors game (untill one player has reached 2 wins)
the time function is seeding our random number generator so that the computer will always have an upradictable number (pick) between 1 & 3.
downside of this method is that the time is in the seconds range so if you run this function faster then every second will have the same value occassionally. 
(only changes every second)
which doesnt matter for this application as it only runs function on start
